This research project will develop hardware and software for processing, learning and recognizing ambient sounds aboard an autonomous mobile robot, so that it can identify, localize and capture moving targets in a simulated indoor environment while playing a game of ?Cops and Robbers?. The first portion of this project will consist of hardware development, sensor design and signal processing to acquire sounds from the ambient environment. These signals will then be used in tandem with machine learning algorithms to recognize and characterize a variety of useful sound features encountered during the ?Cops and Robbers? game.
