((3, u'Auditory pattern learning and recognition for autonomous robotic perception', u'1', 43, None, u'Autonomous mobile robots are constrained by size, weight and power to carry limited sensing payloads, most often active/passive vision sensors (i.e. lidar or cameras) or active sonar. As a result, robots are often ?deaf? to ambient sounds, which can be a very valuable source information in indoor or urban environments. This research project will develop hardware and software for processing, learning and recognizing ambient sounds aboard an autonomous mobile robot, so that it can identify, localize and capture moving targets in a simulated indoor environment while playing a game of ?Cops and Robbers?. The first portion of this project will consist of hardware development, sensor design and signal processing to acquire sounds from the ambient environment. These signals will then be used in tandem with machine learning algorithms to recognize and characterize a variety of useful sound features encountered during the ?Cops and Robbers? game. This will allow the robot to update its uncertain understanding of the world as it plays the game with both passive vision and aural sensors. \r\n', u'Familiarity with basic acoustic signal processing, hardware design, and basic ROS/Python programming are required ', u'', u'', u'', u''), (4, u'Creating Tactile Graphics for Blind People', u'5', 42, None, u'The Superhuman Computing Lab is creating new technology to help blind and visually impaired individuals see images, such as photographs, charts, and illustrations. Students on this project will develop web-based or Android applications to translate visual information to haptic feedback using the TPad Tablet. Students will also test the efficacy of these techniques through user studies with blind and sighted users. Students should have prior programming experience in Java or HTML/Javascript.

Testing will be carried out using a lab stagnation flow reactor available in the JSCBB (chemical and biological engineering - East Campus). Reduction and oxidation (redox) experiments will be carried out in the temperature range of 1300 to 1500 deg C. The DL Apprentice will analyze the data in order to identify reaction rates and possible rate expressions which can be used for modeling. \r\n', u'Senior Status', u'prior lab research desired ', u'', u'', u''), (7, u'Radar Remote Sensing from Unmanned Aircraft', u'6', 53, u'http://cet.colorado.edu', u'CU IRISS, CET, and Black Swift Technologies are collaborating on the development, testing, and field validation of small Unmanned Aircraft System (sUAS) with a microminiaturized radar for cloud and rain detection and possible snowpack measurement. Tight integration of the sensor with the sUAS avionics and airframe will enable precise flight control for low altitude missions in the range of 15m-30m above ground level (AGL) required for the sensor to accurately map snowpack to ~30 cm in depth. Operation during future IRISS storm missions could provide a critical capability to measure fine rain structure and Doppler motion in tornado-producing mesoscale storms. The project will involve further development and testing of this lightweight radar for operation on the Black Swift SuperSwift sUAS, along with general help in integrating the sensor into the UAS and potential participation in sUAS flight campaigns. An interest in electronic sensing (especially radar), environmental studies, and small unmanned aerial systems is essential, as are excellence performance in undergraduate circuits and systems courses. \r\n', u'ECEN 2260 required, ECEN 3400 preferable.
