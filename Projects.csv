APPM,Machine Learning for earthquake prediction,Stephen,Becker,(303) 492-0662,stephen.becker@colorado.edu,,,,,,,,,"Earthquake prediction is one of the top remaining unsolved problems in geoscience and statistics. While we can predict the weather better and better every year, earthquake prediction has not significantly improved but is obviously of critical importance. This exploratory project plans to apply modern machine learning (ML) techniques (e.g., deep neural nets) to seismic datasets in an effort to evaluate if ML is useful for earthquake prediction; a handful of papers beginning around 2011 have shown some results. In partnership with NVIDIA, our research group has a Tesla K40 GPU, and we plan to run the neural nets using NVIDA cuDNN within a standard ML framework such as Caffe or Theano or Torch.

The striking fact is the non-existence of a theoretic model of the behavior of a student borrower. As a result, the government has little scientific base for making justifiable measures to manage the student loan problem. This project is the first step toward establishing a reliable model of the strategic behavior of student borrowers. Specifically, the standard MertonÍs problem studies how an individual allocates his/her wealth among consumption (which yields immediate satisfaction) and investment in stocks (which generates future cash proceeds). In our model, an individual has an additional investment opportunity: education. The more one spends in education, the higher (yet still stochastic) income stream one will get in the future. Our goal is to use dynamic programming to find the optimal levels of consumption, stocks investment, and education, for a typical individual in our society.",https://sites.google.com/a/dcu.ie/yu-jui-huang/,None,Moderate amount of supervision and interaction with others,Supervision primarily by faculty supervisor,"Nature of work is primarily theoretical, most work on paper/electronic medium",No prior work; student will be starting from basic idea

We intend to analyze how an individual allocates his/her wealth over lifetime among consumption (which yields immediate satisfaction) and healthcare (which leads to longer lifetime). Specifically, our goals are two-fold. First, we will employ techniques of optimal stochastic control to derive a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, from which we can find the optimal healthcare spending process for a typical human being over his/her lifetime. Second, we will calibrate our model to historical data of mortality rates and life expectancies, in order to understand how the ñmedical technology functionî evolves over time.

APPM,Collective decision making in changing environments,Zachary,Kilpatrick,(303) 492-4668,Zpkilpat@Colorado.Edu,,,,,,,,,"Organisms often make decisions in changing environments. For instance, an animal may hunt for food in areas where several others are foraging simultaneously, altering the best spots to feed. In such cases, individuals and groups should employ decision-making strategies where old evidence is weighted less than newer information. For example, ants respond to overcrowded foraging routes by reducing the deposition of pheromone, pushing others to less crowded routes. Thus, there may be benefits to forgetting old information, since it makes organisms more flexible to changing environmental conditions. In this project, we will explore optimal group strategies for decision making in changing environments. A chief focus will be how decision making accuracy is impacted by the rate at which the group forgets old information. In the case of an ant colony, this would be the rate at which deposited pheromone evaporates. We hypothesize that this rate should increase as the rate of environmental change increases.

APPM,How to organize a search party  optimal search strategies of multi-agent groups,Zachary,Kilpatrick,(303) 492-4668,Zpkilpat@Colorado.Edu,,,,,,,,,"Organisms frequently must search to find targets whose position is unknown to them. For example, animals search for food or mates in ways that aim to maximize speed and minimize energy expenditure. In addition, the dynamics of biomolecules can be modeled as a search process. Regardless of the context of searches, it is often desirable to minimize the time needed to find the target, as a measure of search efficiency. In this project, we will study mathematical models describing groups of agents searching for hidden targets. Importantly, the agents can communicate with another in simple ways, such as indicating how long they have been searching in a certain region and if they have found a target yet. By analyzing the equations that describe this process, we will determine how agentsÍ weighting of their neighborsÍ information impacts their time to find the target.

CHBE,Electrochemical upgrading of biomass-derived carboxylic acids,Adam,Holewinski,,adam.holewinski@colorado.edu,,,,,,,,,"High yields of carboxylic acids can be produced from fermentation of biomass-derived sugars. These organic acids are useful precursors to a number of chemicals and fuels, including long-chain alcohols and alkanes. Electrochemical processing is a particularly attractive route by which to achieve these transformations because it is compatible with aqueous feeds (e.g. fermentation broths), which would otherwise require costly separations prior to chemical upgrading. To date, the fundamental mechanisms governing reaction rates and product selectivities during electrochemical conversion of carboxylic acids have been sparingly investigated and are poorly understood. This project will initiate exploratory work to characterize the kinetics of these reactions, and gauge the feasibility on an integrated biochemical-electrochemical (BC/EC) processing routes for biomass. Ultimately we seek to leverage expertise in biomass processing and in electrocatalysis at both CU-Boulder and NREL for the development of a viable single circulating flow-through reactor system combining fermentation, electrochemical reduction/coupling reactions, and in-situ product separation.",,None,Good deal of supervision; student will work as an integral part of a research team,Supervision primarily by graduate students,"Nature of work is primarily experimental, requiring hands-on work in a lab",Some prior work; student will build on work of others

Now we have two NSF projects to further develop and demonstrate the algorithm in over-the-air transmission using software defined radios (SDR). A single data link works as follows. A computer maps messages to transmit signal samples using a transmitter algorithm and sends the samples to a SDR node. The SDR node transmits the signal wirelessly. Another SDR node picks up the signal and sends the samples to another computer which runs the receiver algorithm. The research will have multiple data links.

On the other hand, condensation on glass strongly influences light transmission. As a highly efficient mode of condensation, dropwise condensation has been a topic of significant interest, with a focus on creating non-wetting surface via promoter coatings for rapid droplet removal. Recent advancements in surface engineering have allowed for the development of micro/nanostructured surfaces, on which nearly spherical water droplets form with high mobility and minimal droplet adhesion. When small droplets merge on suitably designed such surfaces, they can undergo coalescence-induced droplet jumping which has offered a new avenue to further enhance heat transfer.
